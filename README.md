This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"Colorful Pinball: Density-Weighted Quantile Regression for Conditional Guarantee of Conformal Prediction"**.

**Authors:** Qianyi Chen, Bo Li (Tsinghua University)

## 📖 Abstract

While conformal prediction provides robust marginal coverage guarantees, achieving reliable **conditional coverage** for specific inputs remains challenging. We propose **Colorful Pinball Conformal Prediction (CPCP)**, a framework that directly minimizes the Mean Squared Conditional Error (MSCE).

Our method leverages a density-weighted pinball loss implemented via a **Three-Head Network**, trained through a three-stage calibration procedure:
1.  **Estimation**: Jointly train three quantiles.
2.  **Fine-tuning**: Optimize the central quantile through minimizing the pinball loss with estimated density-based weights.
3.  **Conformalization**: Apply standard split conformal prediction on rectified nonconformity scores.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Please ensure the following dataset files are present in the `./Datasets/` directory (as required by `data_utils.py`):

- `bike_hour.csv` (Bike Sharing)
- `diamonds.csv` (Diamonds)
- `gt_full.csv` (Gas Turbine)
- `naval.csv` (Naval Propulsion)
- `sgemm_product.csv` (SGEMM GPU Kernel)
- `super.csv` (Superconductivity)
- `transcoding_measurement.tsv` (Video Transcoding)
- `WEC_Perth_49.csv` (Wave Energy)

### 2. Running the Benchmark

The `main.py` script is set up to run the full benchmark suite across all datasets and methods mentioned in the paper.

To reproduce the experiments:

Bash

```
python main.py
```

### 3. Customizing the Run

The script currently iterates through all datasets and methods. To run specific experiments (e.g., only CPCP on the Bike dataset), you can modify the lists in `main.py`:

Python

```python
# In main.py:

# Select specific datasets
dataset_loaders = {    
    "bike": load_bike,
    # "diamond": load_diamonds,  # Comment out others to skip
}

# Select specific methods
methods = [
    # ('Split', run_split),
    ('CPCP-Clip+Mix', lambda *a, **k: run_rcp_density_improved(*a, epsilon=0.02, mode='clip', clip_max=5.0, mix_ratio=0.5, **k)),
]
```

## 📊 Methods Implemented

- **Split**: Standard Split Conformal Prediction.
